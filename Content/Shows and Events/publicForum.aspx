            Are there some things money can't buy? Do we have obligations to each other as citizens? In the spirit of free exchange epitomized by more than 50 years of The Public’s Shakespeare in the Park, join in an evening of theatre and public debate. This one-night-only Public Forum will include Shakespeare readings about money and justice as well as a lively town-hall conversation with the audience conducted by Harvard professor and best-selling author <span class="bold">Michael Sandel</span> about the way the language of money has been taking over our lives – the subject of his recent book, <span class="italic">What Money Can’t Buy: The Moral Limits of Markets.</span> 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>This Public Forum event is presented in partnership with the Aspen Institute Arts Program (Damian Woetzel, Director).</p>
