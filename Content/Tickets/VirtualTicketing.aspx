        <p class="bold red font_21px">WELCOME TO FREE SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARK VIRTUAL TICKETING</p>
        <p class="bold">Free tickets are distributed at 12pm (noon) each day there is a public performance via the Virtual Ticketing system.</p>
        <p>A request for tickets is not a guarantee you will receive them.  You will be notified, via email, if you have been selected.  Participants are randomly selected by the computer system, based on availability, and not in the order requests are received.</p>
        <p class="bold red font_21px">HOW TO REQUEST FREE TICKETS</p>
        <p><span class="bold red font_21px">STEP 1:  CREATE AN ACCOUNT</span><br />​​​​​​​​​​ If you are new to Virtual Ticketing and you don’t have an account, you will need to first create one.  Accounts are limited to one per person.  Multiple accounts will be deleted and jeopardize your chance of receiving tickets.  </p>
        <p><a href="http://vtix.shakespeareinthepark.org/" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a> to create an account.  If you already have one, go to STEP 2.</p>
        <p><span class="bold red font_21px">STEP 2:  SIGN-IN​​​​​​​​​​</span><br />Once you have an account, you can sign-in between midnight and 12pm (noon) on the day of each public performance and request 2 tickets.</p>
        <p>If you have an account, <a href="http://vtix.shakespeareinthepark.org/" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a> and follow the instructions to request tickets. You may indicate if your request is for General, Senior (65+), or Accessible (ADA) seating.</p>
        <p><span class="bold red font_21px">STEP 3:  SEE IF YOU WON​​​​​​​​​​</span><br />An email will be sent to you after 12pm (noon) letting you know if you have or have not been selected to receive tickets.</p>
        <p>Those selected may pick up their tickets between 5:30pm and 7:30pm at the Delacorte Theater Box Office under the name and address used for registration. Please pick up your tickets on time, as tickets not picked up by 7:30pm will be released to the stand-by line. There are no exceptions to this policy.</p>
        <p>Tickets are limited to two (2) per person. Specific locations are not available through Virtual Ticketing.</p>
