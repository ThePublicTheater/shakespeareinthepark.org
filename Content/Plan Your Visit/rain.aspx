   <p class="bold red font_21px margin_20px"> WHAT IF IT RAINS?</p>
   <p class="margin_20px">We will never cancel a performance before it is scheduled to begin. Rain at 8pm may clear by 8:30pm, so it is best to always assume the show will perform as scheduled.</p>
    <p>In the event of rain or severe weather, the start of the performance may be delayed; however, the performance will begin as soon as it is possible to do so. Performances may also pause for sudden changes in weather, but will resume as soon as weather permits.</p>
    <p class="margin_20px">If a performance is canceled due to rain, or for any other reason, free tickets are not valid for re-issue or exchange. Umbrellas may not be opened in the theater.​​</p>
